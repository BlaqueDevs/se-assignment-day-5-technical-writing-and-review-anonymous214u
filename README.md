## 1. How can understanding your audience’s expertise level (tech experts vs. regular folks) shape the way you present technical information?

- Tailoring Information for Different Audiences
- Expect industry jargon, acronyms, and advanced concepts without needing simplification.
- Experts prefer in-depth technical details, including APIs, frameworks, algorithms, and performance metrics.
- Detailed architecture diagrams, code samples, and technical specifications improve clarity.
- Avoid jargon and use plain language with relatable examples.
- Emphasize how the system helps them rather than the underlying technology.
- Infographics, screenshots, and short videos make technical information more digestible.

## 2. What are some strategies to tailor your content to different audience types?

- Understand Your Audience: Identify their expertise level, Know their goals, Assess their pain points
- Adjust Language & Complexity depending on the audience types
